### Overview
This is a ticketing system based on the two seperate ticketing systems I use on a daily basis at my current position as a technical analyst for a CRM software. We use two different systems since both have features the other one lacks, and I figured that the process can be simplified by bringing the best features of both together.
The system allows clients and analysts to both login, view, update, and exchange information on a support ticket created by the client. It allows clients to get updates on the work the analyst has done, and requires fields to ensure that the analyst has the information needed to resolve the issue.

### Features
User login: Clients and Analysts will be able to create accounts and log in to the application, both with different interfaces. Each user will have a profile and overview of open tickets.
Create and Modify Tickets: Users will be able to create new tickets when logged in. New tickets will appear in the open ticket overview and have options for modifications and updates.
Ticket Update Notifications: Users will be able to create new tickets when logged in. New tickets will appear in the open ticket overview and have options for modifications and updates.
